The file SamplePosterior.nb is a mathematica script for sampling the posterior distribution of a reaction-diffusion model from a field release of mosquitoes in Burkina Faso, to estimate mosquito density, survival, and dispersal (the diffusion rate). To run the sampler, the data file needs to be inputed, and the mathematica package mcmc.m needs to be installed (available from https : // github . com/joshburkart/mathematica - mcmc ). The data file contains the data from two mosquito sampling methods - "swarm" and "PSC" (Pyrethroid spray catch). The swarm sampling gave rise to a larger number of recaptures and is more reliable for parameter estimation. The file SamplePosterior.nb gives an example of runing the MCMC algorithm to sample 10000 pts in the Posterior distribution.
